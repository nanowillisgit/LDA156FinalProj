# Linear Discriminant Analysis Final Project

**Authors**: Aatmun Baxi, Andy Chen, Johnny Mo, and Abhi Vemulapati

## Description

This repository contains the total sum of the work done for our final project for Math 156. This includes the LaTeX source and PDFs for the proposal and report, the slides for the report, and the Python notebook of our implementations.

The purpose of the final project is to gain a strong mathematical understanding of the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for two problems in machine learning: classifcations problems and dimesionality reduction. We will present the mathematical formalities of the LDA and give two or more implementations of LDA, with at least one implementation for classification and at least one for classification.
