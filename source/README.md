# Grabbing the data

Some of the data used in the project is too large to push to a GitHub repository, so we provide sources for our data so the source code can be run locally.

## Data Sources

To replicate the directory structure for local execution, grab the data from the following links, extract if needed, and place in the `data/` directory.
If any further configuration is necessary, we provide variables in our scripts with approximately the name `data_path` as a prefix for the data path.
Modify it if needed.

- [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist)

**Note:** the `.py` files are scripts we used in getting our implementations together, so they may be buggy, inefficient, or incomplete. They are included for completeness. The `LDANotebook.ipynb` is the collection of our final applications along with write-ups of our results.
